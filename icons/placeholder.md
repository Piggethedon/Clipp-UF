# Icons Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Clipp extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Flag Icons for Language Switcher:
- `flag-sv.png` - Swedish flag (16x12 pixels)
- `flag-en.png` - English/UK flag (16x12 pixels)

## Icon Requirements:
- Use the Clipp brand colors (blue theme)
- Maintain consistency across all sizes
- Ensure icons are crisp and clear at all sizes
- Consider both light and dark browser themes

## Temporary Solution:
Until custom Clipp icons are created, you can use placeholder images or copy existing icon files to this directory.

The manifest.json and popup files reference these icon files, so make sure they exist for the extension to work properly.
